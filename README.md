# Find-all-preperiodic-points-of-Dynamics-System-over-function-fields
<img src="Images/sagemath.png" width=200> 
The goal of the project is to find pre-periodic points of a dynamic system defined over function fields. The goal of the project is to implement the Hutz algorithm in the open source environment Sage based on the Python language, using algebraic and arithmetic properties of the function field to calculate the pre-periodic points more efficiently
and fast. Using the algorithm we want to get a list of graphs of periodic points similar to the Poonen hypothesis.
