The goal of the project is to find [**pre-periodic points**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_point) of a [**dynamical system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) defined over function fields by implementing the [**Hutz algorithm**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.6246.pdf) in the open-source environment [**Sage**](https://www.sagemath.org/) based on the Python language, using algebraic and arithmetic properties of the [**function field**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_function_field) to calculate the pre-periodic points more efficiently and fast. </br> 
By using the algorithm we want to get a list of graphs of periodic points similar to the [**Poonen hypothesis**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9512217.pdf).
</br>

In the **test** folder there's Jupyter Notebook file which has some python code to test the functions we added to Sage ,we put the functions we wrote at the start of the file and after that we runed this functions on some dynamic systems we chose to show the graphs of the pre-periodic points.  


In the **images** folder there's some pictures of the graphs we got after runnig the algorithm on a number of **Dynamic Systems** defined over **Function Fields** over 
[**Finite Field**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) .

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?p,f(p),f^{2}(p),..." title="p,f(p),f^{2}(p),..." />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are only pre-periodic points because after a number of iterations they become periodic (as shown in the picture above) <br/> <br/>
**_Input of the algorithm_:** A dynamical system defined over ùë≠ùíí(ùíï) (function fields) where ùë≠ is a finite field .<br/>
**_Output of the algorithm_:** List of all preperiodic points of the dynamical system.
