# Find all preperiodic points of Dynamics System over function fields
<img src="images/logo_sagemath+icon_oldstyle.png" width=200> 
The goal of the project is to find pre-periodic points of a dynamic system defined over function fields by implementing the Hutz algorithm in the open-source environment "Sage" based on the Python language, using algebraic and arithmetic properties of the function field to calculate the pre-periodic points more efficiently and fast. </br> 
By using the algorithm we want to get a list of graphs of periodic points similar to the Poonen hypothesis.
